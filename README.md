This project aims to create a AstroDx controller for the Samsung Galaxy Tab

Cooking in progress! Here are some devlogs!

## 01/01/2026: My 3D printer is back!
Few weeks ago I broke my printer so I had to postpone this project for some weeks. I got a new one now so I should be able to hop back into action. Right now I'm in the process of designining the case. Since the design is pretty much constraied by size, I had to draft the case first to get a better idea on how much space I can have once I start putting down the parts in. 

I'm thinking of creating a PCB for this design and some Khail hotswap sockets. They are easy enough to source and should be low profile enough so it looks somewhat proportional to the actual cab. Yes the PCB of course will add up to the overall cost if someone needs to build this instead of just using generic Omron switches - but my reasoning to this is that I want this to be as compact and integrated as possible. 

The schematic and the code of this project is very basic and pretty much just a simple keyboard hid. I have bunch of codes that I have made prior to this project that should let me just reuse the same code and call it the day.

Anyways, I'll keep working on the case and hopefully get something finished and done in one or two weeks
